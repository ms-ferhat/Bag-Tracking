# 🔧 Project: IoT-Based Bag Tracking App 

As part of my journey through the Information Technology Institute (ITI) in Summer IoT course, I’ve developed a Bag Tracking App using the Master of Things IoT platform.  

## Key Features:
⚫ Bag Status Page: Displays live data on the current location and conditions of the bag, including GPS coordinates, sensor readings like lux levels.  
⚫ History Page: Tracks a detailed log of previous locations and statuses, giving users the ability to review movements and important events over time.  
⚫ Proactive Alerts: The app sends an automatic email alert if the bag moves more than 100 meters away from the user or when the Bab open, adding an extra layer of security and responsiveness.
